Getting Started 1. Install pip install edgartools There are frequent releases so it is a good idea to use pip install -U edgartools to get new features and bug fixes. That being said we try to keep the API stable and backwards compatible. If you prefer uv instead of pip you can use the following command: uv pip install edgartools 2. Import edgar The main way to use the library is to import everything with from edgar import * . This will give you access to most of the functions and classes you need. from edgar import * If you prefer a minimal import you can use the following: 3. Set your identity Before you can access the SEC Edgar API you need to set the identity that you will use to access Edgar. This is usually your name and email , but you can also just use an email. You can set your identity in Python before you start using the library. Setting your identity in Python from edgar import * set_identity(\"mike.mccalum@indigo.com\") Setting your identity using an environment variable You can also set your identity using an environment variable. This is useful if you are using the library in a script or notebook. export EDGAR_IDENTITY=\"mike.mccalum@indigo.com\" Usage Getting Filings The library is designed to be easy to use and flexible. You can start by getting all filings for the current year and quarter with get_filings() . filings = get_filings() You can expand beyond the current year and quarter by using the parameters of the get_filings function. For example you can specify the year you want to get filings for: filings = get_filings(year=2021) For more details on filtering filings see the Filtering Filings docs Selecting a filing You can select a filing using the [] operator. For example to get the third filing in the list: filing = filings[3] Paginating filings The Filings object is a container for a list of filings. The list of filings can be large but by default you can only see the first page of filings. To change the page, you can paginate filings using the next and prev methods. For example: filings = get_filings() filings.next() filings.prev() Looping through filings You can loop through filings using the for loop. For example: filings = get_filings() for filing in filings: # Do something with the filing Getting Related Filings Filings can be related to other filings using the file number. In some cases this relationship can be meaningful, as in they represent a group of filings for a specific securities offering. The link between the filing is via the file_number attribute of the filing, which is an identifier that the SEC uses to group filings. You can get related filings using the get_related_filings method. For example: filing = get_filing('0000320193-22-000002') filings = filing.related_filings() Getting a Company You can start by getting a company by CIK or Ticker with Company() . For example: c = Company(\"AAPL\") filings = c.filings You can also get a company by CIK. For example: c = Company(\"0000320193\") filings = c.filings To get a Company by ticker, the library first does a lookup of the CIK for the ticker and then gets filings for the CIK. So if you know the CIK, it is faster to use that directly. Company Filings You can get the filings for a company by using the filings property. For example: filings = c.filings This property returns a Filings object that you can use to filter and manipulate the filings. Initially the filings property lists around 1000 filings for the company that were returned from the API call to the SEC. Normally this is OK since these are the 1000 most recent filings. However, some companies have more than 1000 filings, and you might need to get older filings. To trigger the retrieval of older filings you can use the get_filings() method. For example: filings = c.get_filings() Getting Company Facts You can get facts for a company using the get_facts() method. For example: facts = c.get_facts() The result is an EntityFacts object that wraps the data returned from the SEC API. To get the data as a dataframe use the to_pandas() method. For example: facts_df = facts.to_pandas() Getting Company Financials You can get financials for a company using the financials property. For example: financials = c.financials financials.income_statement Viewing unpublished filings The SEC publishes the filing indexes week nights by 10:30 PM EST. To get the latest filings not yet in the index use the get_latest_filings function. For example: filings = get_latest_filings()","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#edgartools-documentation","text":"edgartools is a Python library for navigating SEC filings.","title":"Edgartools Documentation"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#1-install","text":"pip install edgartools There are frequent releases so it is a good idea to use pip install -U edgartools to get new features and bug fixes.

You also filter while getting filings using the get_filings function or after getting filings using the filter method. For the most part these approaches will give identical results, except that with get_filings you are filtering from all available filings in the SEC, while with filter you are reducing the nu,ber of filings in a Filings object. Filtering using parameters of get_filings You can filter using parameters of the get_filings function. Get filings by form To get filings of a specific form type like 10-K, you can use the form parameter. For example: filings = get_filings(form='10-K') The form can also be a list of forms. For example: filings = get_filings(form=['10-K', '10-Q']) By default the amendments parameter is set to True so that amended filings are included. You can set it to False to exclude amended filings. For example: filings = get_filings(form='10-K', amendments=False) Filtering by date You can filter filings by date using the filing_date parameter. For example: filings = get_filings(filing_date='2022-01-01') You can also filter by a range of dates. For example: filings = get_filings(filing_date='2022-01-01:2022-01-10') You can filter up to a date. For example: filings = get_filings(filing_date=':2022-01-10') as well as after a date.

For example: filings = get_filings(cik='0000320193') Filtering by ticker You can filter filings by ticker using the ticker parameter. For example: filings = get_filings(ticker='AAPL') Note that this first does a lookup of the CIK for the ticker and then gets filings for the CIK. So if you know the CIK, it is better to use that directly. Filtering by exchange You can filter companies using the exchange parameter. filings = get_filings(exchange='NASDAQ') There are the following exchanges available: Exchange Nasdaq NYSE CBOE OTC Filtering using Filings.filter You can filter filings using the filter method after getting filings.

Language) for regulatory filings. While commonly referred to as SGML, it implements a simplified version with SEC-specific tags and structures. This format has been the backbone of SEC filings since the 1990s, chosen for its ability to maintain consistent document structure while supporting both structured data and free-form text. Understanding SGML Container Formats You might be familiar with SGML from having seeing the Full Text File (.txt) or the (.nc) formats in SEC filings. The SEC EDGAR system actually utilizes two distinct SGML container formats, each serving different purposes in the filing process: Complete Submission Text File (.txt) The .txt format contains the complete submission as received by EDGAR, including all documents, headers, and content. This is the primary public-facing format that preserves the exact submission. A typical .txt container begins with: <SEC-DOCUMENT>0000320193-24-000123.txt : 20241101 <SEC-HEADER>0000320193-24-000123.hdr.sgml : 20241101 <ACCEPTANCE-DATETIME>20241101060136 ACCESSION NUMBER: 0000320193-24-000123 The .txt container includes: - Full document content - SEC headers - Metadata - All exhibits and attachments - Processing timestamps Non-Public Complete File (.nc) The .nc format serves as a submission manifest or index file, containing metadata about the filing without the full content. This format is used for processing, validation, and internal SEC workflows. A typical .nc container starts with: <SUBMISSION> <ACCESSION-NUMBER>0002002260-24-000001 <TYPE>D <PUBLIC-DOCUMENT-COUNT>1 <ITEMS>06b <ITEMS>3C The .nc container tracks: - Submission type and status - Document counts - Reporting items - Cross-reference information - Processing instructions - Special handling requirements Understanding the SEC Processing Pipeline Understanding the relationship between these formats is crucial for processing SEC filings: Initial submission includes both formats .nc file is processed first for validation .txt file is processed for content extraction Both files are archived for record-keeping Public access is primarily to the .txt content This dual-format system enables the SEC to maintain separate processing pipelines for submission handling and public access while ensuring comprehensive record-keeping and validation. How edgartools uses SGML The library uses the SGML to get the attachments and important metadata about the filing. filing.attachments the library will get the SGML file and parse it to get the attachments. You will mostly work with the objects and attributes of the Filing class, rather than directly with the SGML file. @property def attachments(self): # Return all the attachments on the filing sgml_filing: FilingSGML = self.sgml() return sgml_filing.attachments The sgml() function will download the SGML file, or read from a file if using LocalStorage . The FilingSGML class The FilingSGML class is used to parse the SGML file. It has a few methods to get the attachments, and the text of the filing. Parsing SGML from a file or a URL The function from_source is used to create a FilingSGML object from a source. The source can be a string representing a file name or a URL, or it can be a Path sgml = FilingSGML.from_source(\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019321000139/0000320193-21-000139.txt\") # OR sgml = FilingSGML.from_source(Path(\"path/to/0001398344-24-000491.nc\")) This will parse either SGML format and return a FilingSGML object. Getting the attachments The attachments property will return an Attachments class that contains the Attachment . attachments = sgml.attachments Getting the content of a file You can get the content of a file using the get_content method. sgml.get_content(\"EX-101.INS\") Getting html You can get the html for the filing using the html method. This will find the primary HTML document in the FilingSGML: attachments, find the html and return it. html = sgml.html() Getting xml You can get the xml for the filing using the xml method.

EdgarTools can parse and extract data from XBRL files into dataframes as well as rich objects that allow you to manipulate and visualize the data inside. While the primary usage of XBRL is for reporting financial data, particularly for 10K and 10Q filings, it is also used to report for other non-financial filings such as 424B offerings. The EdgarTools data model is flexible enough to accommodate a wide variation of data across companies and filings when it comes to XBRL. The Data Model Looking at the data model, it is worth starting at the top. When searching for filings, you can limit the results to xbrl filings by using index=\"xbrl\" . filings = get_filings(index=\"xbrl\") Each Filing has xbrl() function that will download and parse the XBRL attached to the filing or None if it does not. filing = filings[0] filing.xbrl() The xbrl() function will return an XBRLInstance object in simple cases, or an XbrlData object in more complicated cases. Here you can see the XbrlData object for Apple Inc. 10-K filing. It contains the XBRLInstance object, which holds the primary facts reported in the filings, as well as a list of statement. Each statement is a container for a group of facts, such as a balance sheet or income statement. For simpler filings there might only be an XBRLInstance document attached to the filing in which cases .xbrl() will return an XbrlInstance object, and there will be no statements. XbrlInstance The main XBRL container for data is called XBRL instance. It contains the primary data reported for that filing. The data is in a very well-structured XML format, but the EdgarTools XBRL parser unrolls that into a data frame. For simple XBRL, the data inside an XBRL instance is self-contained, so it is straightforward to parse into data structures like data frames. XbrlData For more complicated XBRL, some aspects of the data will have to be resolved against the other XBRL files for that filing, such as the presentation and calculation files. In this case, the parser will return an XBRLData container containing the XBRLInstance and the other XBRL files. These files can include presentation: This file describes how the XBRL data is presented in the filing. It is used to resolve the hierarchy of the data. calculation: This file describes how the XBRL data is calculated. It is used to resolve the calculations of the data. definition: This file describes the definitions of the XBRL data. It is used to resolve the meaning of the data. label: This file describes the labels of the XBRL data. It is used to resolve the labels of the data. Statements But those are the data that go into the XbrlData data object - the output is more interesting. Within the data are usually financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement, or other non-financial statements such as auditor information or firm disclosures. These can be accessed using the XbrlData get_statement() function. To see the statements that are included in the XBRL data, use XbrlData.statements . This is useful and often necessary since firms will use their own specific names for statements. statements = xbrl_data.statements You can access a specific statement using the bracket notation or loop over all the statements statements['CONSOLIDATEDBALANCESHEETS'] This is equivalent to xbrl_data.get_statement('CONSOLIDATEDBALANCESHEETS') Statement Inside each statement is a data frame which you can access using statement.data . statement.data This will also contain metadata columns that you may or may not need to see it's preferable to use statement.get_dataframe() Financials Experts' data can contain both financial and non-financial statements. Mostly you will be interested in financial statements, so the Financials class Is a convenient wrapper over the most common financial statements. financials = Financials(xbrl_data) Summary Hopefully this gives you a good overview of working with XBRL data using edgartools . It's very complicated and a lot of work has gone into XBRL parsing in Edgar tools, and there may still be enhancements to be made.
